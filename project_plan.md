# US Traffic Accident Analysis Project Plan

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze US traffic accident data to identify patterns, correlations, and insights related to time, location, and seasonality of accidents. The goal is to build a system that can understand, analyze, and **predict the probability of traffic accidents** occurring given specific conditions. This predictive capability will help identify high-risk periods and locations for road accidents, potentially improving road safety measures.

## Dataset

We'll be using the US_Accidents_March23.csv dataset, which contains detailed information about traffic accidents including:

- Temporal data (Start_Time, End_Time)
- Geospatial data (Start_Lat, Start_Lng, End_Lat, End_Lng)
- Location information (Street, City, County, State, Zipcode)
- Weather conditions
- Road features (Junction, Crossing, etc.)
- Accident severity

## Research Questions

1. **Temporal Analysis**:
   - What day of the week do most accidents happen?
   - What time of day do most accidents happen?
   - Are there specific months or seasons with higher accident rates?

2. **Geographical Analysis**:
   - Do average times of accidents differ between urban and suburban areas?
   - Are there geographical hotspots for accidents?

3. **Correlational Analysis**:
   - Is there a relationship between weather conditions and accident frequency/severity?
   - Do road features (intersections, traffic signals) correlate with accident frequency?

4. **Predictive Analysis**:
   - **What is the probability of an accident occurring given specific temporal, geographical, and environmental factors?**
   - **Which features are most predictive of accident occurrence and severity?**
   - **How accurately can we predict accident hotspots based on historical data?**

## Implementation Details

### Geocoding Strategy

Since the dataset contains millions of accidents with GPS coordinates, an efficient geocoding strategy is crucial:

1. **Batch Processing**:
   - Process coordinates in batches to avoid API rate limits
   - Cache results to avoid redundant API calls for nearby locations

2. **Tiered Approach**:
   - Start with a local solution (e.g., pre-downloaded shapefiles for US counties/cities)
   - Fall back to API calls for uncertain cases
   - Consider spatial binning to group nearby accidents

3. **API Options**:
   - Nominatim (OpenStreetMap): Free but rate-limited
   - Google Maps API: More reliable but has usage costs
   - Census Bureau API: Good for administrative boundaries

4. **Urban/Suburban Classification**:
   - Use Census Bureau's urban area definitions
   - Alternatively, classify based on population density thresholds
   - Consider road type and density as additional factors

### Performance Considerations

Given the large dataset size (2.8GB):

1. **Chunked Processing**:
   - Load and process data in manageable chunks
   - Consider using Dask or Spark for distributed processing

2. **Selective Feature Use**:
   - Identify and use only necessary columns for each analysis step
   - Create derivative datasets for specific analyses

3. **Caching Strategy**:
   - Cache intermediate results (especially geocoding results)
   - Save processed dataframes for quicker reloading

### Machine Learning Approach

For the predictive modeling components:

1. **Problem Formulation**:
   - **Binary classification**: Will an accident occur under given conditions?
   - **Probability estimation**: What is the likelihood of an accident?
   - **Regression**: How severe might an accident be?

2. **Training Strategy**:
   - **Split data**: Training (70%), validation (15%), testing (15%)
   - **Address class imbalance**: Use techniques like SMOTE or class weighting
   - **Cross-validation**: Implement k-fold cross-validation for robust evaluation

3. **Feature Selection**:
   - **Filter methods**: Statistical tests for feature relevance
   - **Wrapper methods**: Recursive feature elimination
   - **Embedded methods**: Use model-based feature importance

4. **Model Selection and Tuning**:
   - **Grid search** or **Bayesian optimization** for hyperparameter tuning
   - **Ensemble techniques** to combine multiple models
   - **Model stacking** for improved prediction accuracy
